# Youtab Agent Runtime — Master Tracker

The single authoritative record of what is done, what is running, and what is
waiting. A row is only ever marked VERIFIED with evidence that can be re-run;
"it looked right" is not a status.

Queued work is never deleted to tidy this file. An item that stops being
relevant is closed with a reason, not removed — a tracker that forgets is worse
than no tracker, because it reads as complete.

## Position

| | |
|---|---|
| Repository | `eimanghazaei/Youtab-Agent-Runtime` |
| Branch | `feat/youtab-agent-runtime-on-main` |
| PR | **#10** (OPEN, draft) |
| Base | `main@cc4cab2f592e60a197e796506de9168f74baf3ea` |
| PR head | `f81fe9e3be2379b0f533a2b44c4113451bb0682d` |
| **Deployed SHA (protected pre-production)** | **`64b32afb68dc022fc463c72d6e024054fd816e4c`** |

The deployed SHA is tracked separately from the PR head on purpose. They are
not the same thing and have not been the same thing for the whole of this
branch; conflating them is how a "green PR" gets described as shipped.

**No merge and no deployment are authorized.**

## Governed runtime versions

Source of truth is `uv.lock`, which is what the image installs via
`uv sync --frozen` (`Dockerfile:270`). Nothing else may state a version.

| Package | Locked | Enforced by |
|---|---|---|
| fastapi | 0.133.1 | `tests/youtab_runtime/test_framework_version_matches_lock.py` |
| starlette | 1.3.1 | same |
| uvicorn | 0.41.0 | same |

Required CI installs `-e '.[dev,web]'`; the `web` extra carries the same pins.
`.[dev]` alone pins Starlette but not FastAPI, and the core dependency is the
range `fastapi>=0.104.0,<1`, so that path resolved freely and walked a
different router than production builds.

## Known constraints

- **CSRF replay store is single-process.** In-memory nonces; single-use holds
  within one process only. Horizontal scaling stays unqualified until a shared
  atomic store exists.
- **Cookie-session binds have no CSRF coverage.** The gate is scoped to the
  external Access bind. They were never weakened — they were never covered.
- **Docker daemon unavailable locally.** Image build, digest, SBOM and
  container-escape tests are CI/VPS work.
- **`/assets` is conditional.** It exists only when the SPA is built, so route
  qualification must handle both states rather than assume one.

## Next permitted slice

**Complete route authorization registry → enforce explicit default-deny → add
Router-vs-policy CI gate.**

Classification must come from reading endpoint bodies and their data and
mutation authority. Not from path prefixes, route names, UI visibility or
comments. No broad authenticated baseline. Unknown, stale, duplicate or
malformed entries fail closed, and a newly added route makes CI red until it is
classified.

Start with `python scripts/youtab/route_inventory.py --json inventory.json
--by-prefix`. The privileged clusters already carry scopes and are the anchor;
`/api/plugins` at 47 route+methods is the largest unclassified cluster.
