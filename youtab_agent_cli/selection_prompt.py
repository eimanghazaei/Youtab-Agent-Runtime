    Display a multi-select checklist and return the indices of selected items.

    Each item in `items` is a display string. `pre_selected` is a list of
    indices that should be checked by default. A "Continue →" option is
    appended at the end — the user toggles items with Space and confirms
    with Enter on "Continue →".

    Falls back to a numbered toggle interface when curses is
    unavailable.

    Returns:
        List of selected indices (not including the Continue option).
